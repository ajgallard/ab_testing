# A|B Testing - Example Repo
<img src='images/cookie_cats.jpg>
This repo uses real-world data for a small toy example of how to conduct an A|B Test
For this particular notebook the [Cookie Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mursideyarkin/mobile-games-ab-testing-cookie-cats) was used.
The primary steps described in the notebook are as follows:
* Data Preprocessing (only a small amount implemented)
* Chi-Squared Test (Test for Independence)
* Bootstrapping (utilizing the Central Limit Theorem to acquire normalized data centered around the population means)
